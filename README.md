# AWS Source Plugin

*WARNING*: This repository is a fork of the CloudQuery core aws source plugin from the main branch, found at
https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/tree/main/plugins/source/aws

The fork is from commit hash 8ffe2fe13a11144cc4f463b01ede1d59c49fcc96 (29/02/2024).

The AWS Source plugin extracts information from many of the supported services by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Some tables which do not appear in the core version have been added by myself.
